### What is this project about?
This code is used to run an Arduino-based ordering machine which demonstrates practical application of the principles of nudging to support sustainable meal choices.

### What components does this project use?
* Arduino Uno microcontroller board
* LCD display - shows the menu choices and functions as the screem
* LED stripe - displays green, yellow, and red colors (metaphorical traffic light) based on the interaction with the user on two vertical sides of the LCD display
* Three buttons - user's input
* Two servo motors (positional rotation and continuous) - mechanically display different nudging messages at different stages of user interaction by pushing them out
